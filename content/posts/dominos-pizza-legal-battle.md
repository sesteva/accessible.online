Leading US pizza chain, Domino is currently waging a legal battle so that it doesn’t make its website accessible to the blind. The case which began three years ago involved a blind California resident named Guillermo Robles who was unable to order pizza online using his screen reader.

This was against the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA which states that restaurants and online stores must ensure that anyone can participate in the full and equal enjoyment of all services, facilities, goods and accommodations.

Domino is contesting the fact that mobile apps or website didn’t exist in modern form when the ADA was passed in 1990, while Robles had alleged that ADA covers the web, software and the internet.

However, the case was declined by the Supreme Court in October 2019. This implies that all previous court rulings stand and that Domino must make its website and mobile app compliant with the American Disabilities Act (ADA).

Although Domino is disappointed that the Supreme Court declined to rule on this case, the company is determined to move to the trial court which it is asking to create a standard for website accessibility that is separate from the ADA.

Domino believes that the court went too far by determining that websites and mobile apps should be judged as public accommodations instead of been considered as one of the key ways through which customers can access a company’s offering. In a 35 page document, the firm laid out its argument which claimed that the cost of accessibility requirements might run into millions.

Earlier, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco which heard the case in 2018 ruled that Domino websites and the mobile app must be made to comply with the ADA acts.

**What does Domino Legal Battle Mean for Website Accessibility?**

What so many business owners are asking is, what does the Domino legal battle mean for website accessibility?

* First, one major implication of the ruling is that companies with websites that are not fully accessible to people with disabilities might find themselves in court soon.
* Secondly, the Supreme Court determination not to rule on the case is a big victory for disability advocates.
* If Domino Pizza can be in court over issues like website accessibilities, then all businesses must be at alert. There is a need for companies to ask themselves some key questions like
* Does my website work with screen readers?
* Is it possible to navigate through the site without a mouse?
* Does my site pass accessibility guidelines like User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG), ADA, and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines?

**Conclusion**

In all, disability lawsuits have been on the rise, and Domino legal battle is only a flame that encourages disability advocates to file more lawsuits. All business owners must, therefore, test the accessibility of their website now by providing answers to the questions listed above and carrying out a proactive digital accessibility testing which identifies weaknesses in websites and delivers a workable roadmap that addresses all issues.
